This is a story about broccoli and how humanity has devolved with the creation of the Internet. You play as Resley, a fruit and veggie lover who really wants to upgrade his broccoli, so he downloaded a sketchy .vbs script from someone called DJZSwag. Little did he know that this would begin a long journey to save the Box and every universe that exists - all explained through Github and .vbs scripts.

Part 2 is coming out on July ???. Stay Tuned.
